Summary: A teaching utily to graphically animate the stack and heap of
an execution java program.

Explanations:

This utility is a kind of debugger (a jdi client indeed !) where
the user can basically step-line, staying in the main class package and 
when get a feedback: source display with highlighted current line and 
a graphic display for execution stack, class instances and array instances.

Variables, fields, array element what are object or array references
are displayed as arrows and labels (object id based on object
hash). So stack and instances form an oriented graph.

Currently no nice auto layout is provided, but instances are draggable
and so user can correctly layout the instances (to get nice demos for
students for example).
